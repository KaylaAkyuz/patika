# About

This is the sixth part of the homeworks for the GraphQL course of [Patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev/). 

The goal of the homework is to create a web application that uses GraphQL to fetch data from the server. The application is an event management system that allows users to create, update, delete and view events.

# Preview
